# Forecasting_Simulation

This is Jia Yans (giant316) and mine recap + summary for the Forecasting course by Prof. Jacobs (summer term 2020, held online).

The document is written in Markdown for text formatting + Latex for math equations and you see that the images (mostly screenshots) are not included in the Markdown file, but as separate image files.

You can probably view the document in any Markdown viewer, but you might have problems with the image paths  or the math not being displayed correctly.

The Markdown viewer we used is Typora, so here's a quick guide for having the file displayed without problems:

1. Download typora here: https://typora.io/
2. Copy the Github directory as it is, with markdown + image files in the same directory.
3. In Typora, open the settings (Strg+,) and make the following adjustments:
  (i) Image Menu: When Insert... choose option "copy to current folder folder"
  (ii) Image Menu: check "use relative path if possible"
  (iii) Markdown Menu: check inline math
  (iv) Markdown Menu: check highlight
